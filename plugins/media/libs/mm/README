  The PHP media library


  ---- The PHP media library.

  Synopsis
  --------
  Making media processing portable isn't easy. Retrieving meta data from media
  through one of the thousand extension is by times overwhelming. Dealing with
  MIME-types is most often limited to magic lookup.

  This library is concerned with three aspects of media and organized
  accordingly:

  * Processing of media
  * Retrieving media metadata
  * Determining a file's MIME-type

  The set of Media_* classes provide abstractions from underlying extensions or
  libraries and most common methods for operations like resizing and conversion
  (even between i.e. PDFs, movies and images).

  The Mime_Type class helps with determining the MIME-type or correct extension
  of a file or stream. It comes with adapters for the fileinfo extension, glob
  and magic databases from the freedesktop project, as well as modmime style
  databases.

  The files required to make MIME detection work autonomously (i.e. without the
  fileinfo extension installed) are shipped with the library. You'll find those
  files in the data directory. Please note that the MIME magic implementation in
  pure PHP will always be a lot slower than the PHP extensions in C and currently
  has to be considered experimental

  Download
  --------

  Installation
  ------------
  1. Extract the downloaded archive.
  2. Move or copy the extracted directory davidpersson-mm-[hash]
     to /path/to/your/libraries.
  3. Put the src directory of it in your include path.
     {{{
          ini_set('include_path',ini_get('include_path') . PATH_SEPARATOR . '/path/to/mm/src');
     }}}
  4. Classes must be configured prior to using them.
     {{{
          require 'Mime/Type.php';
          require 'Media/Process.php';
          require 'Media/Info.php';

          Mime_Type::config('Magic', array(
          	'adapter' => 'Fileinfo'
          ));
          Mime_Type::config('Glob', array(
          	'adapter' => 'Freedesktop',
          	'file' => '/path/to/mm/data/glob.db'
          ));

          Media_Process::config(array(
          	// 'audio' => 'SoxShell',
          	// 'document' => 'Imagick',
          	'image' => 'Gd',
          	// 'video' => 'FfmpegShell'
          ));

          Media_Info::config(array(
          	// 'audio' => array('SoxShell'),
          	// 'document' => array('Imagick'),
          	'image' => array('ImageBasic'),
          	// 'video' => array('FfmpegShell')
          ));
     }}}

  Running the Tests
  -----------------
  Tests for this library are PHPUnit based. To run the tests you'll need
  to have PHPUnit installed[1]. Following commands will run all the tests.

  $ cd /path/to/mm/src
  $ phpunit ../tests

  issue tracker. You'll find the tracker at:

  Contributing
  ------------
  If you have some ideas for improving this library just fork the repository,
  make your changes and when ready send a pull request to notify me about the
  changes you made. I'll review them and see if I can merge them back. Please
  style your code according to the code which is already there.

  Please note that code which is supposed to be merged into this (blessed)
  repository must carry the same header (including the copyright statement) as
  all code in the library and should be free of any @author tags. This may seem
  a little strange at first. But let me explain: Multiple copyright
  holders/licenses complicate things where not necessary. @author tags seem to
  mark sections of code as belonging to, owned or claimed by the specific author.

  As an alternative the project has a dedicated AUTHORS file where every contributor
  is listed with her/his name/nick along with an email address.
