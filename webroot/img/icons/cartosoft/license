1. General

The mapicon Factory is offered as a web-based service that generates certain icons (each an "Icon") for use in suitable Internet maps. Any access or use of the mapicon Factory is subject to this License.

Cartosoft reserves all patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, registration rights, moral rights, and other intellectual property not expressly granted to you pursuant to this License. You are solely responsible for obtaining the rights to use any intellectual property of third parties in connection with your access and use of the mapicon Factory and the Icons. Cartosoft may terminate this License for cause at any time if you fail to comply in any respect with this License. If you have obtained the right to access or use the mapicon Factory via a test or other non-standard arrangement authorized by Cartosoft, you agree to comply with all of the obligations of a subscriber of the mapicon Factory, and such access or use may be terminated at any time by Cartosoft without incurring any payment obligation or other liability to you.

2. Subscription Agreement

In order to access and use the complete functionality of the mapicon Factory, you must first purchase an annual subscription via the registration and payment methods offered via www.cartosoft.com or such other websites or other sales channels authorized by Cartosoft. You may only access and use the mapicon Factory during the year for which payment in full was made in advance. Your subscription automatically will renew at the end of each year and you automatically will be charged the subscription fees for the next year provided that your payment method remains valid; if your payment method is no longer valid, or if a previous payment is invalidated for any reason, your subscription immediately will be terminated. You may elect to not renew your subscription at any time by requesting via the payment gateway you used to purchase the subscription that your payment method no longer be charged. Subscription fees are not refundable as a result of termination of your subscription by you for any reason, any invalidation of your payment method, or any termination of this License for cause by Cartosoft.
